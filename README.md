How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open File").
2. Click the "Earn $1" button. Your total will increase and persist across page reloads.

Notes

- Uses `localStorage` so the value is stored per browser/profile.
- Press Space (when not focused on an input) to earn as a keyboard shortcut.
